# coding-interview-test

## What you need to accomplish for this test: create a new page similar to the menus page that displays all plates that are assigned to a menu in a grid.

A new module folder for plates has already been created for you and the data and mock API endpoints necessary are already setup.

Our component library is also installed in this project, you can use the PlateCard component in order to display the plates.

When you're done with creating this new page, simply delete the node_modules folder where the dependencies are installed, compress the whole project in a zip file and send it back to Lizbeth by email: lizbeth@foodrelay.ca

Happy coding!
